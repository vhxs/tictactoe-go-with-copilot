# tictactoe-go-with-copilot
How fast could I write tic tac toe in Go, while not knowing Go, but with the aid of GitHub Copilot?

This took me about 30 minutes. While most of Copilot's code recommendations were technically incorrect, that was okay since they were still mostly correct and just took a little tweaking. I'm not sure how much Go I actually learned by doing this, but this was a clear example of Copilot actually boosting a developer's productivity.
